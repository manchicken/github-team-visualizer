# Contributing to Project Name

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes with `cargo test`.
5. Make sure your `cargo clippy` report is clean.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/manchicken/github-team-visualizer/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/manchicken/github-team-visualizer/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
  - Preferably use `rustfmt` to format your code, there's a `.rustfmt.toml` file in the root of the project.
- You can try running `cargo clippy` for style unification
